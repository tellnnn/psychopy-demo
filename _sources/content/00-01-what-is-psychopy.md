As you know, there are several packages to conduct behavioral experiments: Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, E-Prime, and so on. For 2021, I guess that Psychtoolbox and PsychoPy are two of the most prevailed packages because they are free. But, which one should you choose, Psychtoolbox or PsychoPy? To chose one of them, it will be useful to compare them in that their system requirements, timing precision, and so on. The following links will provide some information:

- `Psychtoolbox`: [System Requirments](http://psychtoolbox.org/requirements.html)
- `PsychoPy`: [Timing Issues and synchronisation](https://www.psychopy.org/general/timing/index.html#timing)

Also, there is a nice study exploring timing precisions with a range of packages and configurations {cite}`bridges2020timing`

In the following sections, I will introduce PsychoPy Coder as a tutorial.
